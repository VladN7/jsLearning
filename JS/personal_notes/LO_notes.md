# 15. JavaScript Operators Overview

## Key Objectives:
- Understand the basic operators in JavaScript.
- Recognize the differences between `==` and `===` operators.
- Understand operator precedence and how to use them in combinations.

## Key Concepts:

### Logical Operators:
Used to determine the logic between variables or values.
- `&&` (AND): Checks if both operands are true.
- `||` (OR): Checks if at least one operand is true.
- `!` (NOT): Inverts the boolean value of an operand.

### Comparison Operators:
Used to compare two values.
- `==`: Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
- `===`: Checks if the value and the type of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true.
- `!=`: Checks if the value of two operands are not equal.
- `!==`: Checks if the value and the type of two operands are not equal.

### Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.
- `=`: Assigns the value from the right side operand to the left side operand.

## Practical Applications:
- Use logical operators to make decisions based on multiple conditions.
- Utilize comparison operators to compare values and make decisions in your code.
- Assign values to variables using the assignment operator.

## Notes:
- It's crucial to understand the difference between `==` and `===`. 
- The `==` operator will perform type coercion if the variables are not of the same type, while `===` (strict equality) will not perform type coercion.
- Operator precedence determines the way in which operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.
